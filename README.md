# employee-tracker

## About

This application was designed for users to keep track of their current employees, departments, and the roles their employees have. The user can view all of these tables separately, with the employee table providing the most in depth information (employee's name, id, role, salary, department, and manager's ID.) They can also add a new department, role, and employee. If an existing employee's role is changed, that can also be modified.

## Technologies Used

Node JS, Javascript, MySQL

## Installation

- Run the employeetracker.sql and seeds.sql in MySQL. Be sure to edit the information in the connection variblae in server.js before doing so.
